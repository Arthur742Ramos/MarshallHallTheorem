# Marshall Hall's theorem through finite cores

This repository formalizes Marshall Hall's finite-index free-factor theorem
for finitely generated subgroups of finite-rank free groups. Its main library
theorem is:

```lean
theorem MarshallHall.marshallHall
    {α : Type*} [Finite α]
    (H : Subgroup (FreeGroup α)) [Group.FG H] :
    Nonempty (MarshallHallWitness H)
```

The witness contains a subgroup `K`, the inclusion `H ≤ K`, the finite-index
condition `K.index ≠ 0`, and an explicit equivalence
`H ∗ complement ≃* K` whose left coproduct injection is the actual subgroup
inclusion. Thus the formal statement records the free-factor conclusion, not
merely an abstract isomorphism with some unspecified subgroup.

The same development also exposes a stronger, standalone finite-separator
statement:

```lean
theorem freeGroup_finite_permutation_separator
    {α : Type*} [Finite α]
    (H : Subgroup (FreeGroup α)) [Group.FG H]
    (g : FreeGroup α) (hg : g ∉ H) :
    Nonempty (MarshallHall.FinitePermutationSeparator H g)
```

Here `MarshallHall.FinitePermutationSeparator H g` contains a finite state
type, a homomorphism
`FreeGroup α →* Equiv.Perm State`, a base state fixed by every element of
`H`, and the fact that `g` moves that base state. This is the concrete finite
permutation representation, rather than only an abstract finite-index
existence claim. Its basepoint stabilizer immediately gives the usual
subgroup-separability (LERF) consequence:

```lean
theorem freeGroup_subgroup_separable
    {α : Type*} [Finite α]
    (H : Subgroup (FreeGroup α)) [Group.FG H]
    (g : FreeGroup α) (hg : g ∉ H) :
    ∃ K : Subgroup (FreeGroup α),
      H ≤ K ∧ K.index ≠ 0 ∧ g ∉ K
```

The proof is a finite-state version of the covering-graph argument. A finite
generating set for `H` is extracted from `Group.FG H`. The implementation
enumerates every suffix state of those generators and of `g`, viewed in the
left-coset quotient by `H`. Each generator gives a partial permutation on this
finite core, and `Equiv.extendSubtype` completes it to a permutation of the
finite state set. The constructed representation fixes the base state on `H`
and moves it under `g`; taking the basepoint stabilizer yields the finite-index
separator. The finite-core spanning-tree machinery used by the neighboring
Hall theorem remains available as a separate supporting layer.

The public Challenges are intentionally tiny and Mathlib-only. The checked
finite-core construction is in the `MarshallHall/` modules.

## Additional rank result

The repository also proves the binary free-group instance of
Grushko--Neumann rank additivity:

```lean
theorem MarshallHall.rank_binaryFreeProduct
    {α β : Type*} [Fintype α] [Fintype β] :
    Group.rank (FreeGroup α ∗ FreeGroup β) =
      Fintype.card α + Fintype.card β
```

This identifies the free product with the free group on the disjoint union
of the bases and proves the lower bound through abelianization. The library
also contains the finite indexed analogue:

```lean
theorem MarshallHall.GeneralGrushko.rank_coprodI_freeGroup
    {ι : Type*} [Fintype ι] (α : ι → Type*)
    [∀ i, Fintype (α i)] :
    Group.rank (Monoid.CoprodI (fun i => FreeGroup (α i))) =
      ∑ i, Fintype.card (α i)
```

The next layer is now complete: for arbitrary finitely generated groups, the
finite labelled-graph reduction proves the full binary theorem:

```lean
theorem MarshallHall.rank_freeProduct_eq_add
    {G H : Type u} [Group G] [Group H]
    [Group.FG G] [Group.FG H] :
    Group.rank (G ∗ H) = Group.rank G + Group.rank H
```

The proof starts from a finite subdivided rose for a generating tuple. A
minimal null path contains a null monochromatic run. Safe folds reduce the
vertex set directly; in the edge-reuse case, a source-unfold creates a safe
fold, and an explicit monochromatic-vertex contraction removes the remaining
extra vertex. Both branches preserve the marking, generation, connectivity,
reverse-freeness, and Euler bound, so strong induction closes the separated-
generator theorem and the rank lower bound.

`MarshallHall/GrushkoGeneral.lean` contains the factorwise rank bookkeeping
and the kernel-checked bridge

```lean
Group.rank (G ∗ H) = Group.rank G + Group.rank H
```

for arbitrary finitely generated groups, while `MarshallHall/GrushkoFull.lean`
supplies the complete reduction. The source-unfold and marking-preserving
contraction are split into `GrushkoUnfold.lean`, `GrushkoRemove.lean`, and
`GrushkoUnsafe.lean` so the strict decrease is independently auditable.

## Verification

The project is pinned to Lean 4.32.0 and Mathlib v4.32.0.

```text
lake build
lake env lean --src-deps Challenge.lean
lake env lean --src-deps LERFChallenge.lean
ruby scripts/validate-formalization.rb
./scripts/verify-comparator.sh
./scripts/verify-comparator.sh lerf-comparator.json
```

The Challenge contains one deliberate proof hole. The Solution and the
implementation library contain no proof holes or custom axioms.

The existing Palomar Challenge/Solution surface selects the strengthened Hall
free-factor theorem and the arbitrary-factor Grushko--Neumann rank theorem.
The separate `lerf-comparator.json` surface selects the explicit finite
permutation separator; both it and the derived LERF theorem are proved and
exported by the library root `MarshallHall.lean`.
